## **1. Authors**

This project was created and authored by:
* **Latyr Thiao**


## **2. Requirements / Specifications**

The [business & technical requirements](000-Instructions) that must be met by the solution.

## **3. Prerequisites**

The mandatory steps to be taken to make the code work smoothly.

### **3.1 License**

A Microsoft Office 365 license is required to run the script. 

### **3.2 Installing**

The assumption here is that your computer is running on Windows 10.
Feel free to adjust if you are using a Mac OS or any other operating system.

What software do you need and how to install them?

* Microsoft Office 365 (Microsoft Excel)
* Enable the [Developer tab in Microsoft Excel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLQ8OuW0FlY)


## **4. Tools & Coding Languages**

The following tools and coding languages were used:
* Microsoft Excel
* VBA (Visual Basic Applications)


## **5. Data Source(s)**

The data used as input is coming from the following sources:
* Same Excel files that contain the VBA code. A description on how to download those files will follow later.

## **6. Run the code**

### **Step 1: Download the files**

The [VBA code is available here](001-VBA_Code_&_Data).

Because of the size of these files, they cannot be stored on GitHub.

However the link below will allow you to download them using the link below.
* Download the files here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Vdj54pimvuc1DcbjQ4wQf3vtC0vrcIjm

### **Step 2: Extract Files & run the code**
* Download the zip file
* Extract the files and store them into your preferred location
* Open the preferred Excel file
* Enable editing & enable content, because of the VBA code
* Go to the developer tab (must be enabled)
* Click the Visual Basic button to open the VBA editor
* Run the code by clicking the play icon
* Get a final confirmation message from Excel: "Task complete!"
* Click "ok" as many times as prompted to (usually based on the number of tabs)

**Note:** For the 2nd file named '001-Multiple_year_stock_data (1)', a button is available on the 1st tab called '2016' that allows you to run the code, without accessing the developer tab.

## **7. User Acceptance Testing**

See related document to learn more about acceptence criteria:
